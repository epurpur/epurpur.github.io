I'm a Science & Engineering Librarian and aspiring programmer, currently living in Charlottesville, Virginia. I am a long-time
GIS (geographic information systems) user and a budding programmer. After a few false starts, I took the dive and learned to
program in Python and I am loving its ease of use, versatility, and I'm excited to see where it takes me in the future.

I am specifically interested in combining Python's powers with Geographic Information Systems, mostly QGIS. I really
appreciate the open-source spirit of the QGIS user community and look forward to becoming increasingly involved.

Recently I've been working on adding some existing functionality to existing QGIS plugins. You can see our latest work
at: http://www.keylogeconomics.com/ecovaluator.html
The EcoValuator plugin was originally produced by Key-Log Economics and it's development was funded by a grant from the
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The QGIS EcoValuator provides a simple means of estimating the dollar value of 
recreation, water supply, food, and other services for a given study area. Once installed, the plugin combines satellite data 
on land cover with your own spatial data describing watersheds, conservation areas, townships, or other areas of interest.

I'm writing these blog posts about issues I've struggled with while programming in and experimenting with QGIS. I hope they
serve the wider community as resources and examples of how to do various things and hopefully you won't have to struggle
as long as I did!

In my free time I mostly like to be outside rock climbing and skiing.
